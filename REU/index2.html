        Chemical waves in the cell cortex control cell polarization, migration, and division. While several mathematical models based on reaction-diffusion systems have been developed to explain different wave behaviors, current models typically generate only traveling or standing waves, but not both. We computationally analyzed models by Mori et al. (2008) for standing waves and Michaud et al. (2022) for traveling waves. We discovered that the Michaud model can produce both standing and traveling wave behavior through parameter changes consistent with experimental observations, specifically by varying the F-actin diffusion coefficient from $D_F = 0.001$ (traveling) to $D_F = 0.4$ (standing). We also derived a simplified two-equation model based on the Michaud framework that generates both wave types through the same parameter mechanism. These findings suggest that cells may regulate wave patterns through biochemical control of diffusion rates.
